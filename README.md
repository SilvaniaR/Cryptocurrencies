## Analysis Purpose:
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
## Results:
After preprocessing and clustering the data we found there are 4 classes of crypto and there are 532 tradable cryptocurrencies currently on the market.
